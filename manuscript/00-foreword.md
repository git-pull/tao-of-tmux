# Foreword

Nearly all my friends use tmux. I remember going out at night for drinks and the
three of us would take a seat at a round table and take out our smart phones.
This was back when phones still had physical "QWERTY" keyboards.

Despite our home computers being asleep or turned off, our usernames in the IRC
channel we frequently visited persisted in the chatroom list. Our screens were
lit by a kaleidoscope of colors on a black background. We ssh'd with ConnectBot
into our cloud servers and reattached by running [`screen(1)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen).
As it hit 2AM, our Turkish coffee arrived, the `|away` status indicator trailing
our online nicknames disappeared.

It was funny noticing, even though we knew each other by our real names, we
sometimes opted to call each other by our nicks. It's something about how
personal relationships, formed online, persist in real life.

It seemed as if it were orchestrated, but each of us fell into the same ebb and
flow of living our lives. No one told us to do it, but bit by bit, we
incrementally optimized our lifestyles, personally and professionally, to arrive
at destinations seeming eerily alike.

Like many things in life, when we act on autopilot, we sometimes arrive at
similar destinations. This is often unplanned.

So, when I write an educational book about a computer application, I hope to
write it for human beings. Not to sell you on tmux, convince you to like it or
hate it, but to tell you what it is and how some people use it. I'll leave the
rest to you.

## About this book

I've helped thousands learn tmux through my free resource under the name
[The Tao of tmux](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/en/latest/about_tmux.html), which I
kept as part of the documentation for the [tmuxp session manager](https://github.com/tony/tmuxp).
And now, it's been expanded into a full-blown book with refined graphics,
examples, and much more.

You do not need a book to use or understand tmux. If you want a technical
manual, look at the [manpage for tmux](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1).
Manpages, however, are rarely sufficient to wrap your brain around
abstract concepts; they're there for reference. This learning book is the
culmination of years of explaining tmux to others online and in person.

In this book, we will break down tmux by its objects, from servers
down to panes. It also includes a rehash of terminal facilities we use every day
to keep us autodidacts up to speed with what is what. I've included numerous
examples of projects, permissively licensed source code, and workflows designed
for efficiency in the world of the terminal.

tmux is a tool I find useful. While I don't attach it to my personal identity,
it's been part of my daily life for years. Besides the original resource,
I've written a [popular tmux starter configuration](https://github.com/tony/tmux-config),
a [pythonic tmux library](https://libtmux.git-pull.com), and a
[tmux session manager](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com).

I am writing this from vim running in a tmux pane, inside a window, in a session
running on a tmux server, through a client.

A word to absolute beginners: Don't feel you need to grasp the concepts
of the command line and terminal multiplexing in a single sitting. You have the
choice of picking out concepts of tmux you like, according to your
needs or interests. If you haven't installed tmux yet, please view the
[Installation section](#appendix-installation) in the Appendix of the book.

## Styles

Formatted text `like this` is source code.

Formatted text with a $ in front is a terminal command. `$ echo 'like this'`.
The text can be typed into the console, without the dollar character. For more
information on the meaning of the "dollar prompt", check out [_What is the
origin of the UNIX $ (dollar) prompt?_](https://superuser.com/questions/57575/what-is-the-origin-of-the-unix-dollar-prompt)
on Super User.

In tmux, shortcuts require a [prefix key](#prefix-key) to be sent beforehand.
For instance, `Prefix` + `d` will detach a tmux client from its session. This
prefix, by default, is `<Ctrl-b>`, but users can override it. This is discussed in
greater detail in _the prefix key_ section and [_configuration_](#config).

## How this book is structured

First, anything involving [installation](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1)
and hard technical details are in the Appendix. A lot of books use installation
instructions as filler in the early chapters. For me, it's more of not wanting
to confuse beginners.

For special circumstances, like [tmux on Windows 10](#appendix-windows-bash), I
decided adding screenshots is best, since many readers may be more comfortable
with a visual approach.

[_Thinking in tmux_](#thinking-tmux) goes over what tmux does and how it relates to
the GUI desktops on our computers. You'll understand the big picture of
what tmux is and how it can make your life easier.

[_Terminal Fundamentals_](#terminal-fundamentals) shows the text-based
environments you'll be dealing with. It's great for those new to tmux, but also
presents technical background for developers, who learned the ropes through
examples and osmosis. At the end of this section, you'll be more confident and
secure using the essential components underpinning a modern terminal
environment.

[_Practical usage_](#practical-usage) covers common bread-and-butter uses for
you to use tmux immediately.

[_Server_](#server) gives life to the unseen workhorse behind the scenes
powering tmux. You'll think of tmux differently and may be impressed a
client-server architecture could be presented to end users so seamlessly.

[_Sessions_](#sessions) are the containers holding windows. You'll learn what
sessions are and how they help organize your workspace in the terminal. You'll
learn how to manipulate and rename and traverse sessions.

[_Windows_](#windows) are what you see when tmux is open in front of you.
You'll learn how to rename and move windows.

[_Panes_](#panes) are a terminal in a terminal. This is where you get to work and
do your magic! You'll learn how to create, delete, move between, and resize
panes.

[_Configuration_](#config) discusses customization of tmux and sets the
foundation for how to think about `.tmux.conf` so you can customize your own.

[_Status bar and styling_](#status-bar) is devoted to the customization
of the status line and colors in tmux. As a bonus, you'll even learn how to
display system information like CPU and memory usage via the status line.

[_Scripting tmux_](#scripting-tmux) goes into command [aliases](#aliases)
and the advanced and powerful [Targets](#targets) and [Formats](#formats)
concepts.

[_Technical stuff_](#technical-stuff) is a glimpse at tmux source code and how it
works under the hood. You may learn enough to impress colleagues who already use
tmux. If you like programming on Unix-like systems, this one is for you.

[_Tips and tricks_](#tips-and-tricks) wraps up with a whirlwind of useful
terminal tutorials you can use with tmux to improve day to day development and
administration experience.

[_Cheatsheets_](#appendix-cheatsheets) are organized tables of commands,
shortcuts, and formats grouped by section.

## Book Updates and tmux changes

This book was written for tmux 2.3, released September 2016.

As of January 2017, it's trivial to push out minor changes to
Leanpub. Kindle is harder.

tmux does intermittently receive updates. I've accommodated many over the past 5
years on my personal configurations and software libraries set with [continuous integration tests against multiple tmux versions](https://github.com/tmux-python/libtmux/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yml).
Sometimes, publishers overplay version numbers to make it seem as if it's worth
striking a new edition of a book over it. It's effective for them, but I'd
rather be honest to my readership.

If you're considering keeping up to date with new features and adjustments to tmux,
the [`CHANGES`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/CHANGES) file in the
project source serves as a way to see what's updated between official releases.
