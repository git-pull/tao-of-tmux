# Windows {#windows}

Windows hold [panes](#panes). They reside within a [session](#sessions).

They also have [layouts](#window-layouts), which can be one of many preset
dimensions or a custom one done through [pane resizing](#pane-resizing).

You can see the current windows through the [status bar](#status-bar)
at the bottom of tmux.

## Creating windows

All sessions start with at least one window open. From there, you can create and
kill windows as you see fit.

Window indexes are numbers tmux uses to determine ordering. The first window's
index is 0, unless you set it via `base-index` in your [configuration](#config).
I usually `set -g base-index 1` in my tmux configuration, since 0 is after 9 on
the keyboard.

`Prefix` + `c` will create a new window at the first open index. So, if you're
in the first window, and there is no second window created, it will create
the second window. If the second window is already taken, and the third hasn't
been created, it will create the third window.

If the `base_index` is 1 and there are 7 windows created, with the 5th window
missing, creating a new window will fill the empty 5th index, since it's the
next one in order and nothing is filling it. The next created window would be
the eighth.

## Naming windows

Just like with sessions, windows can have names. Labelling them helps keep track
of what you're doing inside them.

When inside tmux, the shortcut `Prefix` + `,` is most commonly used. It
opens a prompt in the tmux status line, where you can alter the name of the
current window.

The default numbers given to windows also become muscle memory after a while.
But naming helps you when you're in a new tmux flow and want to organize
yourself. Also, if you're sharing tmux with another user, it's good practice to
give a hint what's inside the windows.

## Traversing windows

Moving around windows is done in two ways, first, by iterating through via
`Prefix` + `p` and `Prefix` + `n` and via the window index, which takes you
directly to a specific window.

`Prefix` + `1`, `Prefix` + `2`, and so on... allows quickly navigating to
windows via their index. Unlike window names, which change, indexes are
consistent and only require a quick key combo for you to invoke.

Prompt for a window index (useful for indexes greater than 9) with `Prefix` +
`'`. If the window index is 10 or above, this will help you a lot.

Bring up the last selected window with `Prefix` + `l`.

A list of current windows can be displayed with `Prefix` + `w`. This also gives
some info on what's inside the window. Helpful when juggling a lot of things!

## Moving windows

Windows can also be reordered one by one via `move-window` and its
associated shortcut. This is helpful if a window is worth keeping open but not
important or rarely looked at. After you move a window, you can continue to
reorder them at any point in time after.

The command `$ tmux move-window` can be used to move windows.

The accepted arguments are `-s` (the window you are moving) and `-t`, where you
are moving the window to.

You can also use `$ tmux movew` for short.

Example: move the current window to number 2:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
$ tmux movew -t2

Example: move window 2 to window 1:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
$ tmux movew -s2 -t1

The shortcut to prompt for an index to move the current window to is `Prefix` +
`.`.

## Layouts {#window-layouts}

`Prefix` + `space` switches window _layouts_. These are preset configurations
automatically adjusting proportions of [panes](#panes).

As of tmux 2.3, the supported layouts are:

{width=75%}
![](images/06-window/even-horizontal.png)

{width=75%}
![](images/06-window/even-vertical.png)

{width=75%}
![](images/06-window/main-horizontal.png)

{width=75%}
![](images/06-window/main-vertical.png)

{width=75%}
![](images/06-window/tiled.png)

Specific touch-ups can be done via [resizing panes](#resizing-panes).

To reset the proportions of the layout (such as after splitting or resizing
panes), you have to run `$ tmux select-layout` again for the layout.

This is different behavior than some [tiling window managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager).
[_awesome_](https://awesomewm.org/) and [_xmonad_](http://xmonad.org/), for
instance, automatically handle proportions upon new items being added to their
layouts.

To allow easy resetting to a sensible layout across machines and terminal
dimensions, you can try this in your [config](#config):

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
bind m set-window-option main-pane-height 60\; select-layout main-horizontal

This allows you to set a `main-horizontal` layout and automatically set the
bottom panes proportionally on the bottom every time you do `Prefix` + `m`.

Layouts can also be custom. To get the custom layout snippet for your current
window, try this:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off} # awk(1)
$ tmux lsw -F "#{window_active} #{window_layout}" | awk '$1{print $2}'

    # grep(1) + cut(1)
    $ tmux lsw -F "#{window_active} #{window_layout}" | grep "^1" | cut -d " " -f2

To apply this layout:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
$ tmux lsw -F "#{window_active} #{window_layout}" | awk '$1{print $2}' > 5aed,176x79,0,0[176x59,0,0,0,176x19,0,60{87x19,0,60,1,88x19,88,60,2}]

    # Alternant to above:
    $ tmux lsw -F "#{window_active} #{window_layout}" | grep "^1" | cut -d " " -f2

    # resize your panes or try doing this in another window to see the outcome
    $ tmux select-layout "5aed,176x79,0,0[176x59,0,0,0,176x19,0,60{87x19,0,60,1,88x19,88,60,2}]"

## Closing windows

There are two ways to kill a window. First, exit or kill every pane in the
window. Panes can be killed via `Prefix` + `x` or by `Ctrl` + `d` within
the pane's shell. The second way, `Prefix` + `&`, prompts if you really
want to delete the window. Warning: this will destroy all the window's panes,
along with the processes within them.

From inside the current window, try this:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
$ tmux kill-window

Another thing, when [scripting](#scripting-tmux) or trying to kill the window
from outside, use a [target](#targets) of the window index:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
$ tmux kill-window -t2

If you're trying to find the target of the window to kill, they reside in the number
in the middle section of the [status line](#status-line) and via `$ tmux choose-window`. You can hit "return" after you're in choose-window to go back to
where you were previously.

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned how to manipulate windows via renaming and changing
their layouts, a couple of ways to kill windows in a pinch or in when shell
scripting tmux. In addition, this chapter demonstrated how to save any tmux
layout by printing the `window_layout` template variable.

If you are in a tmux session, you'll always have at least one window open, and
you'll be in it. And within the window will be "pane"; a shell within a shell.
When a window closes all of its panes, the window closes too. In the next
chapter, we'll go deeper into panes.
